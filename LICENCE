LICENCE TERMS
By making any use of the Dress Code Dataset (as defined below), you accept and agree to comply with the terms and conditions of this Licence. 
Your right to use the Dress Code Dataset is subject to and conditional upon your compliance with those terms and conditions.

*** What you can do ***
You can use the Dress Code Dataset only for the purposes of research, teaching and publication (which must in each case be academic and non-commercial).

For the purposes of this provision:
- using the Dress Code Dataset means you can use, copy, publish, distribute and transmit it (in whole or in part), but does not allow you to adapt it 
except as expressly set out below.
- non-commercial means you cannot use the Dress Code Dataset for purposes which are mainly directed towards payment or some other commercial advantage. 
You are not prohibited from academic use simply because it has some incidental commercial nature. For example, use of the Dress Code Dataset in academic 
publication is permitted even if the relevant journal is subject to a subscription fee, and use of the Dress Code Dataset in academic teaching is permitted 
even if that teaching is subject to tuition fees.
- academic means in connection with education, teaching and research activities undertaken by an accredited not-for-profit academic institution, and 
excludes research undertaken in collaboration with any commercial entity except under terms which prohibit that entity from making commercial use of any 
results arising from that research.

We grant to you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license under our respective rights (including copyright and database right) 
in the Dress Code Dataset for the permitted purposes set out above. 
You may adapt the Dress Code Dataset only as necessary to make it interoperable with any other systems or technology which you are using for non-commercial 
academic research, teaching or publication.  Otherwise, you may not adapt it without our permission. Any adaptations which you do make (for interoperability, 
or with our permission) and any other works you make using the Dress Code Dataset will be subject to the same terms and restrictions of this Licence: in 
particular that means you cannot use them for commercial purposes.

If you create any adaptations or other works using the Dress Code Dataset, then you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty free, perpetual, irrevocable 
licence to use, copy, modify, distribute, and otherwise exploit those adaptations or other works for any purposes.

*** Attribution and your downstream obligations ***
If you share the Dress Code Dataset (in whole or in part), you must:
- retain any notices which identify the origins, authors, or rightsholders of the Dress Code Dataset (including without limitation any copyright notice);
- retain any notices which refer to this Licence in whole or in part, or which contain any disclaimers of warranties in relation to the Dress Code Dataset;
- actively notify the recipient that their use of the Dress Code Dataset will be subject to this Licence (and provide them with a link);
- not seek to impose any additional obligations on the recipient in relation to their use of the Dress Code Dataset which would be incompatible with the terms 
of this Licence.

If you publish the Dress Code Dataset (in whole or in part), you must include in that publication an attribution in the following form:
“The Dress Code Dataset is proprietary to and © Yoox Net-a-Porter Group S.p.A., and its licensors. It is distributed by the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 
and available for non-commercial academic use under licence terms set out at https://github.com/aimagelab/dress-code.” 

While you must ensure that you acknowledge us as the source of the Dress Code Dataset as described above, you must not in doing so, or otherwise, suggest that you 
or your use of the Dress Code Dataset is endorsed or sponsored by us, or otherwise connected with us, unless we have separately given you permission to do so.

*** What you must not do ***
You must not use the Dress Code Dataset except as expressly permitted above. In particular:
- You may not use the Dress Code Dataset, or any adaptations or other works created using the Dress Code Dataset, for commercial purposes.
- You may not adapt the Dress Code Dataset except as expressly set out above. In particular, you may not create new works derived from or based upon the Dress Code 
Dataset in which the Dress Code Dataset is wholly or partially translated, altered, or modified in a manner which would otherwise require permissions from the 
relevant rightsholder under applicable laws relating to copyright and/or database rights.
- The images in the Dress Code Dataset depict garments whose designs may be protected by copyright and/or design rights. You are not granted any licence under those 
rights except in connection with your permitted use of the Dress Code Dataset. In particular you are not authorised to make or manufacture any of those garments, 
or to alter their designs in your use of the Dress Code Dataset.
- The images in the Dress Code Dataset have been cropped so that the models featured in those images are not individually identifiable. You must not attempt to 
re-identify those models.

If you become aware of any use of the Dress Code Dataset other than as permitted by this Licence (whether by your own organisation or any third party) you must 
notify us promptly at fabio.cesari@ynap.com and marcella.cornia@unimore.it.

*** No warranty ***
The Dress Code Dataset is provided to you “as is” and we exclude all representations, warranties, and liabilities in relation to the Dress Code Dataset 
(including without limitation as to quality, fitness for purpose, non-infringement and accuracy) to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
Without limiting that exclusion, we will not be liable for any errors or omissions in the Dress Code Dataset or for any loss or damages of any kind arising 
from its use. We do not guarantee that the Dress Code Dataset will remain available, and we may withdraw it at any time. 

*** Term and Termination ***
This Licence applies for the entire duration of any copyright, database right or other rights we may have in the Dress Code Dataset. 
If you breach any of your obligations under this Licence, then without limiting our other rights and remedies, your rights under it will automatically terminate. 
Your rights will be reinstated automatically if you remedy that breach within thirty days after discovery or may be reinstated by our written approval.
We may withdraw this Licence at any time, and if we do you must stop using the Dress Code Dataset as soon as possible unless we make it available to you on 
alternative terms and conditions.

*** Other provisions ***
We will not be subject to any additional terms or conditions which you may seek to introduce in relation to your use of the Dress Code Dataset.
This Licence does not limit your lawful freedoms to use the Dress Code Dataset in reliance on exceptions and exclusions from laws relating to copyright or database 
rights (such as fair dealing or fair use).
If you are in breach of this Licence, we can only waive that breach by written notice. If we do not immediately take action in relation to your breach, we may still 
do so later.
This Licence is the entire agreement between you and us relating to your use of the Dress Code Dataset. You acknowledge that you have not entered into this Licence 
based on any other representation or warranty.
This Licence is governed by the laws of Italy.
